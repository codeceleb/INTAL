# INTAL
INTeger of Arbitary Length. A set of functions to handle really large numbers stored in the form of character arrays.
INTAL - INTegers of Arbitrary Length 
Project Description 
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language 
along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci, etc.
