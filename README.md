# INTAL
INTeger of Arbitary Length. A set of functions to handle really large numbers stored in the form of character arrays.
INTAL - INTegers of Arbitrary Length 
## Project Description 
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language 
along with basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,division,exponential. 

### Skills 
C, Low-Level implementation of arithmetic operations, BigIntegers 
Overview 
Objective 
Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.

### Project Context 


Languages like C++/Java support classes like BigIntegers allowing developers to utilize numbers with up to 100 digits. INTAL aims to provide support up to 1000 digits in the C language along with basic mathematical operations (comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication) and some mathematical functions (Fibonacci series, factorial).
